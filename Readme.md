# Minimax

This is my solution to Berkeley's AI course: http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html

The only file edited is multiAgents.py and the only (as of writing) solved problems are Q2 and Q3.

Run the autograder.py (should give all test pass and a 5/5 score):

```
python autograder.py -q q2
python autograder.py -q q3
```
